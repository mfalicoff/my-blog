# Disco Elysium - The Final Cut

![Disco Elysium](/static/images/games/discoElysium.jpg)

# Context

This will probably start to feel repetitive but I have to say that my experience with old school style CRPG's is pretty limited apart from playing Divinity Original Sin 2 I haven't played much in this genre but having played it originally when it came out due to raging reviews I was very intrigued by this type of narrative focused RPG game so yes this is a replay of this game but my thoughts will not be limited to the Final Cut content, but in general I will speak more about the entirety of the game and how will I feel about it. This will not be a critique since I'm no way qualified to do one specially for this type of game.
