# Disco Elysium - The Final Cut

![Disco Elysium](/static/images/games/discoElysium.jpg)

# Context

This will probably start to feel repetitive but I have to say that my experience with old school style CRPG's is pretty limited apart from playing Divinity Original Sin 2 I haven't played much in this genre but having played it originally when it came out due to raging reviews I was very intrigued by this type of narrative focused RPG game so yes this is a replay of this game but my thoughts will not be limited to the Final Cut content, but in general I will speak more about the entirety of the game and how will I feel about it. This will not be a critique since I'm no way qualified to do one specially for this type of game.

# My Setup

I played the game on my PC, with the following specs:

- RTX 3060TI
- 5800x Stock
- 32GB 3600MHZ
- Installed on SSD

The game run great on my system since it’s not a very demanding game although my fans did ramp up during my playthrough leading me to believe that it may benefit from more optimization. Although this game does have a very low graphics presets for lower end laptops and the like, it’s very cool to see that feature added as this game is very much focused on the narrative than the gameplay side and lowering that barrier of entry would be very much encouraged of more titles in the industry.

# Sound and Music

Good gracious is this OST spectacular, British Sea Power delivered an incredibly fitting and great sounding soundtracks that complements the game like mate complements Argentina. The soundtrack is so superb that I listen to some tracks in my own time, that I think is the true barrier to a great soundtrack. From the open world theme to the sad themes that play at certain locations and missions, to you blasting your sad song on a boombox, it really does increase your immersion in the game as the songs follow the themes of the game and how the actual protagonist may feel at said time or place.

The final cut introduces full voice acting for all characters and inner thoughts, I personally think that it’s a major improvement over the original release, having certain things said aloud sometimes makes the gravitas of said dialogue much more impactful. Although this may not be the case for everyone, it’s sort of how I would imagine a book reader vs and audiobook listener would argue over the original intention of the piece. Personally, I would fall into the book reader but generally gravitate to more audio type narrative in my games. Now the shining start of the VA is the narrator, he was a great choice to do most the inner dialogue and narrative descriptions in the game. Although some of the words are mispronounced when they are of French or German origin, I would like to think that it was done on purpose by the VA director in order to convey the protagonist as being somewhat cultured by for example having read about said event/place in a book but never actually been there or having talked about it with someone else and therefore never having heard the word said aloud.

Overall, we have the same VA’s form the original (except Cuno) only that they’re lines are fully voiced.

# Graphics and Presentation

In the terms of an art cop, the game feature a Watercolor expressionist style of artistic representation. IE the game looks very much like a painting in terms of colors and the actual sprites look like they were painted over. The thing with this game is that apart from navigating the world, there isn’t as much emphasis needed to the actual graphics of the game since it’s not that type of game, instead it focuses on being coherent with the general motif of this general work of art. Furthermore, it also emphasizes the actual feeling that the world coveys, that of being a protagonist stuck in the past, unable to let go.

# Gameplay and Story

Now, this is a though game to write on, and that is due to the very nature of the narrative of the game and the themes and subjects it breaches upon.

Let’s start with the story, you play as \_\_\_ , the name part you must figure it out. A cop from precinct 41 and you and your partner Kim have to investigate a murder that occurred during a labor strike, the story unfolds as you make different choices depending on your skills which will heavily influence how you view and play the story, for example having a high level of encyclopedia will leave you drowning in interruptions as you brain interrupts you constantly with random bits of knowledge.

As you complete quests and main objectives you gain experience which will lead to a level gain, where you can invest said points into the skills (around 20 I believe) that will inevitably have you laughing out loud at how absurd they interact with the main character. Not even joking when I say that this game had me actually laughing hysterically a couple of times, this game’s comedy is on point, not overtly funny but in a more sarcastic way that relies on what is happening in the moment than just making a out of place joke.

These skills are further complemented by the clothing that you decide to wear (which are found or bought throughout the world), by that I mean that the clothing items each provide and increase or a decrease in a certain or multiple skills. The amount of skill you have will then be useful when facing certain checks in the game. This being an old school CRPG, these checks are determined by a simulated dice roll where your total amount rolled plus your skill level has to be over a certain number in order to pass the check, if so you can proceed, if not some of them can be retried if you increase your skill or they can’t in which case it’s missed out content. Therein lies the beauty of this game, as you develop your own character and roleplay as him, your philosophy will be fundamentally incompatible with a certain narrative where you to succeed all checks (even though it’s technically possible if you roll 2\*6).

You can really vary you protagonists, from being a communist fascist cop to a sorry art cop, these core ideals are further cemented into the main character through a mechanic called thoughts, where after certain in-world triggers (after events or discovering new locations) you can uncover new thoughts, i.e. ideas which you can adopt. After adopting said idea your skills will further morph, for example choosing to be a moralist will heal you and raise certain caps for some skills.

I do think that this game can be very powerful in it’s message should you choose to partake in the absurdism that is Disco Elysium, it’s deep in the exploration of the human being and it’s place in the void, socio-economic problems, politics and just about anything that you can think of, this game probably tackles it some shape or form.

# Bottom Line

This second playthrough of Disco Elysium really cements it in my beloved games category, it’s absolutely not for everyone, but for those who enjoy a good thought provoking story, beautiful art and music, or a RPG fan, this game is definitely a must play and one of the best of the genre.

This being the first game release by ZAUM, I’m really looking forward to their next release.
