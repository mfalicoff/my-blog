# Hello World

Hello! This is my new blog, just a place where i can put my thoughts on some media I consume, for now this will probably just be games and books
but may expand into Movies if I feel like it. 

## But Why?
Mainly it's because I like to consume content, and would like to talk about it, it's a way to improve my writing and take on a more analysis approach. 
My first entry will probably be about Nier Replicant followed by Disco Elysium or Gentleman Bastards.
I know nobody is going to read this, but it's mainly for me.

# Thanks for Reading!
