    title: 'Red Seas Under Red Skies by Scott Lynch',
    description: `After a brutal battle with the underworld that nearly destroyed him, Locke Lamora and his trusted sidekick, Jean, 
    fled the island city of their birth and landed on the exotic shores of Tal Verrar to nurse their wounds. 
    But even at this westernmost edge of civilization, they can't rest for long---and they are soon back doing what they do best: 
    stealing from the undeserving rich and pocketing the proceeds for themselves.`,
